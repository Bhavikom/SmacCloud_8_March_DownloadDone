      direction or management of such entity, whether by contract or<br/>
      otherwise, or (ii) ownership of fifty percent (50%) or more of the<br/>

      "Object" form shall mean any form resulting from mechanical<br/>
      transformation or translation of a Source form, including but<br/>
      not limited to compiled object code, generated documentation,<br/>

      "Derivative Works" shall mean any work, whether in Source or Object<br/>
      form, that is based on (or derived from) the Work and for which the<br/>
      editorial revisions, annotations, elaborations, or other modifications<br/>

      of this License, Derivative Works shall not include works that remain<br/>
      separable from, or merely link (or bind by name) to the interfaces of,<br/>
      the Work and Derivative Works thereof.<br/>

      "Contribution" shall mean any work of authorship, including<br/>
      the original version of the Work and any modifications or additions<br/>

      this License, each Contributor hereby grants to You a perpetual,

      copyright license to reproduce, prepare Derivative Works of,
      publicly display, publicly perform, sublicense, and distribute the
      Work and such Derivative Works in Source or Object form.</p>

      this License, each Contributor hereby grants to You a perpetual,<br/>
      worldwide, non-exclusive, no-charge, royalty-free, irrevocable<br/>
      (except as stated in this section) patent license to make, have made,<br/>
      use, offer to sell, sell, import, and otherwise transfer the Work,<br/>
      where such license applies only to those patent claims licensable<br/>
      by such Contributor that are necessarily infringed by their<br/>
      Contribution(s) alone or by combination of their Contribution(s)<br/>
      with the Work to which such Contribution(s) was submitted. If You<br/>
      institute patent litigation against any entity (including a<br/>
      cross-claim or counterclaim in a lawsuit) alleging that the Work<br/>
      or a Contribution incorporated within the Work constitutes direct<br/>
      or contributory patent infringement, then any patent licenses<br/>
      granted to You under this License for that Work shall terminate<br/>
	  as of the date such litigation is filed.<br/></p>
			</li>
</ol>

<ol start="4">
			<li><p style="background-color:whitesmoke;">Redistribution. You may reproduce and distribute copies of the<br/>
      Work or Derivative Works thereof in any medium, with or without<br/>
      modifications, and in Source or Object form, provided that You<br/>
      meet the following conditions:<br/>
	  (a) You must give any other recipients of the Work or<br/>
          Derivative Works a copy of this License; and<br/>

      (b) You must cause any modified files to carry prominent notices<br/>
          stating that You changed the files; and<br/>

      (c) You must retain, in the Source form of any Derivative Works<br/>
          that You distribute, all copyright, patent, trademark, and<br/>
          attribution notices from the Source form of the Work,<br/>
          excluding those notices that do not pertain to any part of<br/>
          the Derivative Works; and<br/>

      (d) If the Work includes a "NOTICE" text file as part of its<br/>
          distribution, then any Derivative Works that You distribute must<br/>
          include a readable copy of the attribution notices contained<br/>
          within such NOTICE file, excluding those notices that do not<br/>
          pertain to any part of the Derivative Works, in at least one<br/>
          of the following places: within a NOTICE text file distributed<br/>
          as part of the Derivative Works; within the Source form or<br/>
          documentation, if provided along with the Derivative Works; or,<br/>
          within a display generated by the Derivative Works, if and<br/>
          wherever such third-party notices normally appear. The contents<br/>
          of the NOTICE file are for informational purposes only and<br/>
          do not modify the License. You may add Your own attribution<br/>
          notices within Derivative Works that You distribute, alongside<br/>
          or as an addendum to the NOTICE text from the Work, provided<br/>
          that such additional attribution notices cannot be construed<br/>
          as modifying the License.<br/>

      You may add Your own copyright statement to Your modifications and<br/>
      may provide additional or different license terms and conditions<br/>
      for use, reproduction, or distribution of Your modifications, or<br/>
      for any such Derivative Works as a whole, provided Your use,<br/>
      reproduction, and distribution of the Work otherwise complies with<br/>
      the conditions stated in this License.<br/>

   5. Submission of Contributions. Unless You explicitly state otherwise,<br/>
      any Contribution intentionally submitted for inclusion in the Work<br/>
      by You to the Licensor shall be under the terms and conditions of<br/>
      this License, without any additional terms or conditions.<br/>
      Notwithstanding the above, nothing herein shall supersede or modify<br/>
      the terms of any separate license agreement you may have executed<br/>
      with Licensor regarding such Contributions.<br/>

   6. Trademarks. This License does not grant permission to use the trade<br/>
      names, trademarks, service marks, or product names of the Licensor,<br/>
      except as required for reasonable and customary use in describing the<br/>
      origin of the Work and reproducing the content of the NOTICE file.<br/>

   7. Disclaimer of Warranty. Unless required by applicable law or<br/>
      agreed to in writing, Licensor provides the Work (and each<br/>
      Contributor provides its Contributions) on an "AS IS" BASIS,<br/>
      WITHOUT WARRANTIES OR CONDITIONS OF ANY KIND, either express or<br/>
      implied, including, without limitation, any warranties or conditions<br/>
      of TITLE, NON-INFRINGEMENT, MERCHANTABILITY, or FITNESS FOR A<br/>
      PARTICULAR PURPOSE. You are solely responsible for determining the<br/>
      appropriateness of using or redistributing the Work and assume any<br/>
      risks associated with Your exercise of permissions under this License.<br/>

   8. Limitation of Liability. In no event and under no legal theory,<br/>
      whether in tort (including negligence), contract, or otherwise,<br/>
      unless required by applicable law (such as deliberate and grossly<br/>
      negligent acts) or agreed to in writing, shall any Contributor be<br/>
      liable to You for damages, including any direct, indirect, special,<br/>
      incidental, or consequential damages of any character arising as a<br/>
      result of this License or out of the use or inability to use the<br/>
      Work (including but not limited to damages for loss of goodwill,<br/>
      work stoppage, computer failure or malfunction, or any and all<br/>
      other commercial damages or losses), even if such Contributor<br/>
      has been advised of the possibility of such damages.<br/>

   9. Accepting Warranty or Additional Liability. While redistributing<br/>
      the Work or Derivative Works thereof, You may choose to offer,<br/>
      and charge a fee for, acceptance of support, warranty, indemnity,<br/>
      or other liability obligations and/or rights consistent with this<br/>
      License. However, in accepting such obligations, You may act only<br/>
      on Your own behalf and on Your sole responsibility, not on behalf<br/>
      of any other Contributor, and only if You agree to indemnify,<br/>
      defend, and hold each Contributor harmless for any liability<br/>
      incurred by, or claims asserted against, such Contributor by reason<br/>
      of your accepting any such warranty or additional liability.<br/>
	  END OF TERMS AND CONDITIONS<br/>

   APPENDIX: How to apply the Apache License to your work.<br/>

      To apply the Apache License to your work, attach the following<br/>
      boilerplate notice, with the fields enclosed by brackets "[]"<br/>
      replaced with your own identifying information. (Don't include<br/>
      the brackets!)  The text should be enclosed in the appropriate<br/>
      comment syntax for the file format. We also recommend that a<br/>
